# Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Hackathon

You had some theoretical instructions what GitHub Copilot can do for you. Now it is time to put it into practice and build something amazing!

**Pre-requisites**

See [Setup Instructions](./README.md#pre-requisites) for the pre-requisites required to participate.

## How to participate in the Hackathon.

**What about the practical application?**

We have demonstrated GitHub Copilot's main features; however,

- The features are tool features, not capabilities (what you do and why you use them)
- Now it is time to discover what GitHub Copilot can do for you!

**What are we going to do**

- You will start exploring GitHub Copilot's capabilities in your chosen project.
- You will apply what you've learned in a practical setting.
- Use your project (work- or hobby-related) as a playground.
- Just start coding as you normally would and experiment with how GitHub Copilot can assist you.

**How are we going to do it**

- Work in pairs if applicable.
- In our repository, you will find a [GOALS.md](./hackathon/GOALS.md) file that contains activities.
- Use the activities as a scorecard to track your progress.
- Use our scorecard template to document your achievements.

## If you did not bring your own code

If you do not bring your own code, you can have a look at the [Ground School](./GROUNDSCHOOL.md#challenges-instructions) challenges to get some inspiration what you can do

## If you did not setup your machine

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](./CODESPACES.md#available-codespaces) to quickly get a development environment up and running.
