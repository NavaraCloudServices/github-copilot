## Forked from

This repository was forked from the official [Microsoft Copilot Hackathon](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotHackathon). Thank you to the Microsoft team for their great work!

## Goal

The goal of a GitHub Copilot Ground School is to learn how to use it through a set of [Exercises](#exercises). These exercises consist of building a web server using Nodejs with different functionalities, a .NET Web API, C++, Python or a Java Rest API (either Spring Boot or Quarkus).

For those who are already familiar with GitHub Copilot, we have also defined a series of [Challenges](#challenges-instructions) to test your skills. You will find an introduction and short guidance to help you solve the challenge, but you will have to do most of the work on your own (with the help of Copilot, of course).

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or entire functions based on the context of what youâ€™re working on. By using Copilot, you can learn how to write better code and improve your productivity.

Remember:

- As you type, GitHub Copilot will make suggestions, you can accept them by pressing Tab.
- If nothing shows up after Copilot writes some lines, press enter and wait a couple of seconds.
- Press **Ctrl + Enter**, to see more suggestions.
- Use Copilot chat to support your learning and development.
- Press **Ctrl + i** to start Copilot chat inline within your code.

## Pre-requisites

You need an GitHub Copilot license. You can participate with a free license, however, we expect that you hit the rate limit of the free license during the challenges.

There are three ways to execute the exercises.
