> [!NOTE]  
> Thousands gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on the second day of February to await the spring forecast from a groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil. According to legend, if Phil sees his shadow the United States is in store for six more weeks of winter weather. But, if Phil doesn’t see his shadow, the country should expect warmer temperatures and the arrival of an early spring.
